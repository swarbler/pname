# pname

a simple program I made that selects names randomly from a list file

## What is it?

pname is a text-program that lets you select a random name from a list.txt file with fun ASCII art! It can also be set to read a pre-existing list (e.g. "year10.txt")

## How to Run 🏃

You can run revisionio using two methods:

- Download exe produced by pyinstaller from the releases page
- Download the source code and run the Python file

You can add names to the list.txt file. For regular use, you can prepare a list file, such as "year10.txt", and set that as your list file. You are able to switch between multiple list files. 

> note: When creating list files, write each name in a new line. Using spaces means pname will treat it as multiple names instead of one, so try not to use spaces! If you must use spaces, try using "-" or "_" instead. (e.g. "john-smith" or "bob_the_builder")
